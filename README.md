# Personal Resume Website

This is a personal resume website created using HTML. The website features a clean, structured layout showcasing my professional background, along with a contact page that includes links to my GitHub and Gmail using PNG icons. Currently built with HTML, I plan to add CSS and other features gradually.

## Features
- **Professional Resume**: A well-organized resume with key information such as skills, experience, and education.
- **Contact Page**: A second page featuring clickable GitHub and Gmail icons.
- **HTML-Only for Now**: Built using only HTML for simplicity, with plans to add CSS and other features in the future.

## Capstone Project
This project was developed as part of the **Web Development Course by Angela Yu**. It serves as a capstone project to demonstrate the skills learned throughout the course.

## Learning Journey
I am currently in the process of learning web development and have completed several foundational steps. This project represents what I have learned so far, and I plan to continue improving and expanding my skills with CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced features in the future.
